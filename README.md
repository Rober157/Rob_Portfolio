# Data Science portfolio by Roberto Rey
This portfolio is composed by a compilation of data science projects regarding machine learning and data analysis. Chairs that are not public can be found [here](https://github.com/RoberRey/RoberRey.github.io/tree/main/Datasets).
## Non Parametrics.
### [KDA in Ovals](https://github.com/RoberRey/RoberRey.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/KDA.md)
Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) is a nonlinear version of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), both of them are well-known and widely used techniques for supervised feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. The Ovals dataset contains 3000 observations, it has 3 columns which are the X and Y coordinates and a label, the Ovals' name comes from the shape that these dots form. In this notebook we perform both approaches (including also QDA) and we compare their accuracy.
### Kernel mean shift clustering in MNIST dataset
Kernel mean shift clustering is a strong nonparametric technique that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters. It's a centroid-based algorithm that works by updating centroids candidates to be the mean of the points in a given region. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten 0−9 digits used in mailing. Each observation is a grayscale image made of 28 × 28 pixels that is recorded as a vector of length 28<sup>2</sup> = 784 by concatenating the pixel columns. In this notebook we are using KMSC techinque to investigate different ways of writing the digit “3”.
