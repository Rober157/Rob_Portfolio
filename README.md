# Data Science portfolio by Roberto Rey
This portfolio is composed by a compilation of data science projects regarding machine learning and data analysis. Datasets that are not public can be found [here](https://github.com/RoberRey/RoberRey.github.io/tree/main/Datasets).
## Non Parametrics.
### [KDA in Ovals](https://github.com/RoberRey/RoberRey.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/KDA.md)
Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) is a nonlinear version of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), both of them are well-known and widely used techniques for supervised feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. The Ovals dataset contains 3000 observations, it has 3 columns which are the X and Y coordinates and a label, the Ovals' name comes from the shape that these dots form. In this notebook we perform both approaches (including also QDA) and we compare their accuracy.
### [Kernel mean shift clustering in MNIST dataset](https://github.com/RoberRey/RoberRey.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/KMS.md)
Kernel mean shift clustering is a strong nonparametric technique that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters. It's a centroid-based algorithm that works by updating centroids candidates to be the mean of the points in a given region. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten 0−9 digits used in mailing. Each observation is a grayscale image made of 28 × 28 pixels that is recorded as a vector of length 28<sup>2</sup> = 784 by concatenating the pixel columns. In this notebook we are using KMSC techinque to investigate different ways of writing the digit “3”.
## Biostatistics.
### [Cox Proportional Hazards Model with Time-Dependent Covariates](https://github.com/RoberRey/RoberRey.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/Cox_Model.md)
Proportional hazards models are a class of survival models in statistics. Survival models relate the time that passes, before some event occurs, to one or more covariates that may be associated with that quantity of time. In a proportional hazards model, the unique effect of a unit increase in a covariate is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate. The dataset used is [mgus2](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/survival/html/mgus.html) from the survival package in R and it contains the natural history of 1341 subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Our goal is to fit a proportionals hazards model in order toobtain the effect of a unit increase in a covariate to concludewhich of the covariates may lead to death.
